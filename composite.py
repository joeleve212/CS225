# lo and hi are further proof of the dislike of full-word-typing: think low and high

def sieve(lo,hi):
#You will need to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes 
#which finds all the primes in a range of numbers
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes explains it
# A good way to start is to build a list of all the numbers 
# tip: "range" is a tool in python/Google is an OK resource for the language!
#ANSWER: below and 
# FILL IN THIS SECTION!!!!!!!!!! of code.

#Uhoh  What is that Strange 1: action?
#Answer: it is only taking the items from index 1 onwards, instead of capturing the file name in index 0 as well

    #ANSWER: a list of the input arguments (as strings) from the command line
